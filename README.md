# Fake-News-Research
Fake news research paper code from Summer Ventures program

This repo includes the Jupyter Notebooks, a folder of confusion matrices that show the data, and a folder with viualizations of words within the training datasets.
The models and datasets themselves are too large to be stored on GitHub and must be independently downloaded and placed.

As such, when running the Jupyter Notebooks, the file paths MUST be changed.
The test file can only be run after the train file has created models.

The training dataset can be found here:

The test dataset can be found here:

Most algorithms will train quickly (under ten minutes) except for the Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms.
